= Friendly Demo

== Getting Started
=== Installation

First, obviously, you'll need FriendlyORM:

  gem install friendly

You'll also want memcached for the caching portion:

  gem install memcached

Oh, and yeah, you'll probably want rails. I did the demo with 2.3.4;
you can either install that version or change the version requirement
in config/environments.rb

  gem install rails -v2.3.4

=== Setup

  rake db:create:all
  rake db:migrate
  rake spec # make sure everything passes
